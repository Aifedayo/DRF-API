Continuation from the last update

Some we created a Django project and named it cfeapi, then an app called updates. Both folders are in `/src`

Next, we created a class Update in our models and declared several instances, also created a func that will be called whenever we want to update our image instance.

We also pip install pillow since we are using an ImageField.
