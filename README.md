# Django Rest Framework API Introduction and API Basics
Building a solid RESTAPI service following Udemy Course.
This first part is really an overview of concepts that build up what an API is how we're going to use it.
Application Programming Interface are not just for the web.
RESTAPI is a standardized way to provide data to other applications and the applications are free to use them however they want.
In fact they have all sorts of applications across various areas.

It is a window to the Database.

The fundamental definition of API is a method of communication between software components.
GUI simplifies using programs while an API simplifies making them

Uses cases for API and its concepts 
  * Run a process or routine
  * Use Hardware
  * Use Third Party Assets
  * Internal Data and external date
  * Activate sensors
  * Send messages

Basically what API does is that it makes it easier to build softwares

What are Web Resources: 
  * Data
  * Documents
  * Audio
  * Images
  * Videos

`JSON, XML, HTML` through the web through these specifies data types

URL & URI:
  * Uniform Resource Locator: More general
  * Uniform Resource Identifier: More specific. A link to ny given web resource, where does an audio file exists, the link to it. Also a URI can be referred to as URLs and API Endpoints


HTTP Protocol Methods:
  * POST (create)
  * PUT (update)
  * GET (retrieve)
  * DELETE (delete)
  * PATCH (Updates individual field records)
  * UPDATE

Softwares are designed in the ideas of CRUD (pronounced as crod): Create - Retrieve - Update - Delete

**Client Consumes REST APIs**


**HTTP GET (retrieve)**: _Requests are sent to server through a URI and the server does some lookup and returns a response in JSON data and the client-side parses the response and presents data_


**HTTP POST (create):** _Devices sends request to the server side and returns a response asa JSON Data and client-side parses data and presents data_


**HTTP PUT (update):** _Same as the create, retrieve_


**HTTP DELETE (delete):** _Same as the above but with different method_


The process of querying and converting tabular database values into JSON is known as `Serialization`

| **Server-side Tech** | **Client-side Tech** |

| Python/Django    | Angular.         |
| Node.js | React |
| Ruby on Rails |. iOS |
| PHP | Android |

  * Scalability
  * Server to Server
  * Multiple Client-side Tech
  * Internet of things
  * Microservices
  * Rapid Development
